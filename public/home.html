        We are a University of Florida student organization in association with
        the Seventh-day Adventist church, providing a Christian atmosphere for
        those who choose to take part.
        Our missions is to share the love of Jesus Christ and spread the Advent
        message, primarily to the University of Florida students and secondarily
        to the community of Gainesville. To represent the love of Jesus Christ
        by having no prejudice to sex, race, or religious background, of not
        only those we help and support on our campus, but also to those who wish
        to attend our meetings and special events. We are planning to accomplish
        these goals by organizing open campus activities and Bible discussions,
        fellowship, and large events.
